# archive-links

a simple archival tool for capturing snapshots on a schedule

## Usage

1. clone/fork the repo
1. update and commit `manifest.txt`
1. upload/push to your own GitHub

To push an update to `manifest.txt` on the main branch without triggering the workflow, suffix your commit message with ` [skip ci]`.
